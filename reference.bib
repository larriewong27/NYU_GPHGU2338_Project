 abstract = {Selection of a subset of meaningful covariates for a statistical model is an important and often time-consuming task in model building. Lawless and Singhal (1978, Biometrics 34, 318-327) proposed a method for best subsets selection for nonnormal models. We develop a method for logistic regression that may be performed with any best subsets linear regression program.},
